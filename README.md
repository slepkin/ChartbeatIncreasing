An API to retrieve data about all top-100 pages whose visitor count has increased since 5 seconds ago (or since it was last in the top-100).

To start, run `foreman start` from the application directory. This requires the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/). Then, browse to `localhost:5000`.
